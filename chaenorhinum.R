# Description: The aim of this script is to explore the breeding system of C. rodriguezii. 
# Here we analyse the data obtained in field experiments (i.e. bagging) as well as other 
# data collected (i.e. floral visitors, pollen/ovule ratio)

## CONCLUSION: All types of seed are different. When studying the breeding system, we should use only
#  black seeds for weight, but we can use together black and white for number of seed (think about using 
#  deformed or not). 
#  We could see if there are some differences in number of deformed seeds in the Autogamia treatment vs Control


# Using a non-parametrical test after Kruskal-Wallis test (TukeyHSD is the parametric test)
# Dunn uses the same ranks used in Kruskal-Wallis. It's appropriate for groups with unequal numbers of observations
# Bonferroni correction is more conservative regarding TypeI errors (false positives)
krus_dunn <- posthoc.kruskal.dunn.test(weight_seeds$weight100 ~ weight_seeds$seed_type, p.adjust.method = "bonferroni")
krus_dunn  # All types of seed are different.

#      1         2      
# 2  0.0078      -      
# 3  0.0028   2.7e-09

# Another option (non-parametric) but I would use Dunn's test
krus_conover <- posthoc.kruskal.conover.test(weight_seeds$weight100 ~ weight_seeds$seed_type, p.adjust.method = "bonferroni")

## Fitting a Mixed Model with random effects: population and year ##
# A fixed effect "exhausts the population of interest" -> "year" could be any, but we have only 3; thus, it is random
#                                                      -> "population" could also be more than Puig Major and Massanella; thus, also random
